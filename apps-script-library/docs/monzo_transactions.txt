Transactions

Transactions are movements of funds into or out of an account. Negative transactions represent debits (ie. spending money) and positive transactions represent credits (ie. receiving money).

Most properties on transactions are self-explanatory. We'll eventually get around to documenting them all, but in the meantime let's discuss the most interesting/confusing ones:

Properties

Property	Description
amount	The amount of the transaction in minor units of currency. For example pennies in the case of GBP. A negative amount indicates a debit (most card transactions will have a negative amount)
decline_reason	This is only present on declined transactions! Valid values are INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, CARD_INACTIVE, CARD_BLOCKED, INVALID_CVC or OTHER.
is_load	Top-ups to an account are represented as transactions with a positive amount and is_load = true. Other transactions such as refunds, reversals or chargebacks may have a positive amount but is_load = false
settled	The timestamp at which the transaction settled. In most cases, this happens 24-48 hours after created. If this field is an empty string, the transaction is authorised but not yet "complete."
category	The category can be set for each transaction by the user. Over time we learn which merchant goes in which category and auto-assign the category of a transaction. If the user hasn't set a category, we'll return the default category of the merchant on this transactions. Top-ups have category mondo. Valid values are general, eating_out, expenses, transport, cash, bills, entertainment, shopping, holidays, groceries.
merchant	This contains the merchant_id of the merchant that this transaction was made at. If you pass ?expand[]=merchant in your request URL, it will contain lots of information about the merchant.

Returns a list of transactions on the user's account.

 Strong Customer Authentication
After a user has authenticated, your client can fetch all of their transactions, and after 5 minutes, it can only sync the last 90 days of transactions. If you need the user‚Äôs entire transaction history, you should consider fetching and storing it right after authentication.
